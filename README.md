# Counter App
This is a basic counter app built with React Native. This was built for an an assignment of mine from a cohort that [Danny Thompson](https://x.com/DThompsonDev/status/1769907604107477027?s=20) put together. The instructions were:
> Create a very basic counter app in react native. The app should show a number and have  '+' & '-' buttons which should add or subtract 1 from the number.

## How It' Made:
**Tech used**: React Native and CSS

This was my first time working with React Native and, while the documentation is fine, it is more different from React than I expected. However, I suppose that is needed if they want to maintain the ability to create fully native apps on both iOS and Android.
## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to create components, style them, and add interactiveity. It was good to see part of my react familiarty come into play with the ability to use state for this simple application.
